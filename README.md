# GitHub Operations Script

This script allows you to interactively perform common Git operations. It includes a variety of options for managing repositories, branches, commits, deployments to GitHub Pages, and integration with GitHub Codespaces. The operations are accessible through an easy-to-use text-based menu.

## Features:

1. **Clone a Repository**
   Clone any GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Create and Checkout Branches**
   Create new branches or switch between existing ones.

3. **Stage and Commit Changes**
   Add changes to the staging area and commit them with a message.

4. **Push and Force Push Changes**
   Push your local changes to the remote repository. The script also allows for forced pushes, which will overwrite remote changes.

5. **View Commit History**
   Show all commits made on the current branch.

6. **Revert to a Previous Commit**
   Revert to a specific commit using its hash.

7. **Pull Latest Updates**
   Pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

8. **Update `README.md`**
   Open `README.md` for editing in the Pluma text editor. After editing, you can commit and push the changes to the repository.

9. **GitHub Pages and Codespaces Operations**

   * **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Deploy the current repository to GitHub Pages.
   * **Open GitHub Codespace**: Create and open a new GitHub Codespace for the current repository and branch.

10. **Exit**

  ```bash
  sudo apt install pluma
  ```
* **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Required for GitHub Codespaces integration. Install it using:

   ```
2. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   Enter the new branch name: feature-xyz
   ```
3. Commit changes:

   ```bash
   Enter commit message: Added new feature XYZ
   ```
4. Push changes to the repository:

   ```bash
   Do you want to push changes to the repository? (y/n): y
